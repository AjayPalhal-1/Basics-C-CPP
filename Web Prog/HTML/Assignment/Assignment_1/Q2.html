            <strong>Maharashtra Institute of Technology (MIT)</strong> is the first private Engineering Institute 
            to be established in the city of Pune, Maharashtra. It is one of the premier institutes
            for Indian and international students offering Undergraduate and Postgraduate courses in
            Engineering, Management, Medicine, Pharmacy, Design, and so on.     
            Contributing towards the industrial, economic, and social growth of the society for over
             a quarter of a century, Maharashtra Academy of Engineering Education and Research (MAEER)’s
            MIT Group of Institutions has helped realize the dreams and aspirations of thousands of stu
            dents. The group has spread its wings across Maharashtra with campuses in Kothrud, Alandi,
            and Loni- Kalbhor within Pune, along with Latur, Talegaon, Ambejogai, and Pandharpur.
            Being the brainchild of its visionary founder, Prof. Vishwanath D. Karad, MAEER established 
            in 1983, managed to craft a niche position for being a one-of-its-kind undertaking that

                R&D AT MITAOE
               </h3> 
                Research is the extensive expansion of the existing stock of knowledge through high 
                concentration of energy, effort and intellectual thought process that gives new dimensions
                 to ideas, which produce far-reaching and everlasting results. It is the pursuit of novelty 
                 with the help of study that includes observation, comparison, experiment, collecting and
                  analyzing facts or data, and reaching desired conclusions either in the form of solution(s) 
                  towards the concerned problem or in certain generalizations for some theoretical 
                  odeling/formulation. Precisely, the persistent quest for knowledge through objectives and 
                  systematic methods of finding solution(s) to a problem is research. In Research and 
                  Development, one does research for the development of new techniques/ methods for inventing 
                  and improving a product as per the requirements of industry / society in terms of quality, 
                  cost, manpower, energy consumption, time etc. <br><br>

            To facilitate all the R & D activities in our institute among students and faculty/staff
         members, the R & D cell is functional and is being steered by the Director, Dean (R&D) and
          active representatives from each department. A unique incentive increment scheme was 
          introduced in 2008 for encouraging and boosting R&D culture in the institute.
